/*You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer.
 * In order to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes
 * the following data types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have
 * any manuals, so you canâ€™t look this information up. Write a C++ program that
 * will determine the amount of memory used by these types and display the
